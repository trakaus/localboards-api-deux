# localboards-api-duex
====================

Exploring an alternative approach to building the local boards api utilizing NodeJS. The first approach was done in Ruby on Rails and can be found [here](https://github.com/noahkoch/api-localboards-org).

The focus of this approach is not to change any of the request urls or functionality. It is purely to drive participation with a more widely known development language <tt>JavaScript</tt>.


# Usage
See documentation [here](https://github.com/noahkoch/api-localboards-org/blob/master/README.md#base-path).
